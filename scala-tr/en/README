../../lib/scalariform.jar has Turkish keywords (dez, den, tanÄ±m)
for code formatting in the Script Editor in Kojo.
It is from https://github.com/bulent2k2/scalariform.git

This directory is here to keep an original copy with only English
keywords. At some point in the future, we want to be able to
switch the languages back and forth in one unified Kojo/Koco.
