To bump up the scala compiler, say to 2.13.9, we would need to repeat what I did for 2.13.6:
(0) Create a new repo scala-2.13.6-tr from the source code 'scala-2.13.6.tar.gz' found in [Assets](https://github.com/scala/scala/releases/tag/v2.13.6)
    E.g., https://github.com/bulent2k2/scala-2.13.6-tr
(1) Clone and build scala compiler from that repo
    - But first do the few changes to two files as in:
      https://github.com/bulent2k2/scala-2.13.6-tr/commit/8fafc8c0ff86e3b12269c4380bad8c14ff1f3bd5
      -- src/reflect/scala/reflect/internal/StdNames.scala
      -- src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/ast/parser/Scanners.scala
      And optionally:
      -- src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/Main.scala
    - Make sure to use java 8 or 11 and not 15.

(2) Copy lib folder including contents from <path-to-your-clone>/scala-2.13.6-tr/build/pack/lib
    to ./build/pack/lib and override the old jars.
    E.g., /Users/ben/src/scala-2.13.6-tr/build/pack
